## If you build Ferret from these source files, please note:

The `site_specific.mk.in` and `external_functions/ef_utilites/site_specific.mk.in`
files in the repository must be copied to files without the `.in` extensions, and
the contents of these `site_specific.mk` files edited for your system configuration.
The `site_specific.mk` files will be ignored by git (the name was added to
`.gitignore`) so your customized configuration files will not be added to your
repository if you have cloned this repository.

The definitions of CC, FC, and LD (the last only for building external
functions written in Fortran) were moved to the `site_specific.mk.in` files.
(These were previously defined in the `platform_specific.mk.*` files.)
If you already have customized `site_specific.mk` files, please appropriately
updated your customized files with these additional definitions.
