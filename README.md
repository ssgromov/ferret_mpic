## If you build Ferret from these source files, please note:

The `site_specific.mk` and `external_functions/ef_utilites/site_specific.mk` 
files in the repository have been renamed with a `.in` appended to the name. 
You must copy these files with the `.in` extensions to create files with the 
`site_specific.mk` name and edit the contents to configure these for your 
system.  The `site_specific.mk` files will be ignored by git (the name was 
added to `.gitignore`) so your customized configuration files will not be 
added to your repository if you have cloned this repository. 

#### The `site_specific.mk.in` configuration template file changed April, 2018.

Library directories are now specified instead of installation directories
for NetCDF, HDF5, ReadLine, and SZ, with the makefile environment names
changing from `..._DIR` to `..._LIBDIR`.
The `include` directories, if needed, are assumed to be sibling directories
to these library directories.
You may wish to create a new `site_specific.mk` configuration file 
from this updated configuration template file.
